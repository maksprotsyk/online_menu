                                need refreshing drinks. This lager beer is 
                                the perfect companion to pizza, burgers 
                                and fried chicken, but don't let the 
                                pairings stop there. The cans and 
                                package make this beer easy to transport 
                                wherever Budweiser is needed.

                                The legendary Cosmopolitan is a simple cocktail 
                                with a big history. It reached its height of 
                                popularity in the 1990s, when the HBO show “Sex and the City” 
                                was at its peak. The pink-hued, Martini-style drink was a favorite 
                                of the characters on the show. It made its debut during the 
                                second season and became a series regular after that.<br><br>
                                For a good decade, the Cosmopolitan may have been the most 
                                popular cocktail in America, and bartenders couldn’t work 
                                a shift without making dozens of them for thirsty patrons. 
                                Naturally, its ubiquity spurred countless riffs, from the 
                                White Cosmo (St-Germain in place of Cointreau) to versions 
                                featuring gin. While the drink isn’t as popular today as it 
                                was in its heyday, the classic recipe is still very much alive.

                            <hr>
                            <p>
                                The Long Island Iced Tea was popularized in 
                                the 1970s and remains a beloved drink. It’s 
                                possible the cocktail was born out of Prohibition, 
                                when thirsty scofflaws wanted to disguise their booze. It’s 
                                also possible the drink sprung up in the ’70s at a 
                                bar in Long Island, or maybe at a TGI Friday’s. This 
                                much is known: You still can’t throw a lemon wedge 
                                inside the chain restaurant without knocking one over.<br><br>
                                On paper, the Long Island Iced Tea is 
                                one hot mess of a drink. Four different—and 
                                disparate—spirits slugging it out in a single glass, 
                                along with triple sec, lemon juice and cola? The recipe 
                                reads more like a frat-house hazing ritual than one of the 
                                world’s most popular cocktails. And yet, somehow, it works.
